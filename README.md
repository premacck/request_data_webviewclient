Request Data - WebViewClient
====================
Android WebViewClient with a custom WebResourceRequest that contains the POST/PUT/... payload of XMLHttpRequest requests

This project is inspired by https://github.com/KeejOow/android-post-webview and draws some code from there.
Also, this project is a kotlin conversion of https://github.com/KonstantinSchubert/request_data_webviewclient


When you need to display a webview to the user on which you need to intercept the HTTP calls and perform them yourself (for example to add additional security), you can do so on Android by registering a `WebViewClient` and implementing 

```
WebResourceResponse shouldInterceptRequest(android.webkit.WebView webview, WebResourceRequest request)
```

Unfortunately, the `request` object passed to this method does not contain any POST data.

This project provides a hack around this limitation by injecting a script into the HTML that intercepts AJAX calls.

It provides the `WriteHandlingWebViewClient` class that extends `WebViewClient` and provides the 
```
WebResourceResponse shouldInterceptRequest(final WebView view, WriteHandlingWebResourceRequest request)
```
method to override.

`WriteHandlingWebResourceRequest` extends `WebResourceRequest`, but provides the crucial method
```
public String getAjaxData()
```
which returns the data in the request body of the AJAX request.


# Installation

 * Add the `writeinterceptingwebview` folder as a libarary module to your android project. 
 * jCenter-Maven package will come as soon as I figure out how to do that ... Say what you want about pip, at least it's easy to upload a package.
 
 
 # Example usage 
 
 ```
 webView.setWebViewClient(new WriteHandlingWebViewClient() {
    @Override
    public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, WriteHandlingWebResourceRequest request) {
         // works the same as WebViewClient.shouldOverrideUrlLoading, 
         // but you have request.getAjaxData() which gives you the 
         // request body
    }
});
```

# What about forms? What about other kind of http requests?

The library can probably be extended to work for forms too. In fact, https://github.com/KeejOow/android-post-webview shows how it's done. However, I wasn't happy with my adaption of this so far. Pull requests are welcome ...
